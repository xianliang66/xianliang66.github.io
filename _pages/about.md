I am a software development engineering at Alibaba Cloud, working on the cloud scheduling system. Prior to that, I received my bachelor and master degree in Software Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong university](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2018 and 2021, respectively. During my master program, I work with my supervisor [Prof. Zhengwei Qi](https://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/detail/386_968.htm). I also collaborate with [Prof. Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/)
and [Prof. Xiangyao Yu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yxy/). I am interested in the cloud computing, operating systems, and distributed systems.
